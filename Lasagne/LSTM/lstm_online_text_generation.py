'''
Recurrent network example.  Trains a 2 layered LSTM network to learn
text from a user-provided input file. The network can then be used to generate
text using a short string as seed (refer to the variable generation_phrase).
This example is partly based on Andrej Karpathy's blog
(http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
and a similar example in the Keras package (keras.io).
The inputs to the network are batches of sequences of characters and the corresponding
targets are the characters in the text shifted to the right by one. 
Assuming a sequence length of 5, a training point for a text file
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" would be
INPUT : 'T','h','e',' ','q'
OUTPUT: 'u'

The loss function compares (via categorical crossentropy) the prediction
with the output/target.

Also included is a function to generate text using the RNN given the first 
character.  

About 20 or so epochs are necessary to generate text that "makes sense".

    This function produces a semi-redundant batch of training samples from the location 'p' in the provided string (data).
    For instance, assuming SEQ_LENGTH = 5 and p=0, the function would create batches of 
    5 characters of the string (starting from the 0th character and stepping by 1 for each semi-redundant batch)
    as the input and the next character as the target.
    To make this clear, let us look at a concrete example. Assume that SEQ_LENGTH = 5, p = 0 and BATCH_SIZE = 2
    If the input string was "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    For the first data point,
    x (the inputs to the neural network) would correspond to the encoding of 'T','h','e',' ','q'
    y (the targets of the neural network) would be the encoding of 'u'
    For the second point,
    x (the inputs to the neural network) would correspond to the encoding of 'h','e',' ','q', 'u'
    y (the targets of the neural network) would be the encoding of 'i'
    The data points are then stacked (into a three-dimensional tensor of size (batch_size,SEQ_LENGTH,vocab_size))
    and returned. 
    Notice that there is overlap of characters between the batches (hence the name, semi-redundant batch).

        This function uses the user-provided string "generation_phrase" and current state of the RNN generate text.
        The function works in three steps:
        1. It converts the string set in "generation_phrase" (which must be over SEQ_LENGTH characters long) 
           to encoded format. We use the gen_data function for this. By providing the string and asking for a single batch,
           we are converting the first SEQ_LENGTH characters into encoded form. 
        2. We then use the LSTM to predict the next character and store it in a (dynamic) list sample_ix. This is done by using the 'probs'
           function which was compiled above. Simply put, given the output, we compute the probabilities of the target and pick the one 
           with the highest predicted probability. 
        3. Once this character has been predicted, we construct a new sequence using all but first characters of the 
           provided string and the predicted character. This sequence is then used to generate yet another character.
           This process continues for "N" characters. 
        To make this clear, let us again look at a concrete example. 
        Assume that SEQ_LENGTH = 5 and generation_phrase = "The quick brown fox jumps". 
        We initially encode the first 5 characters ('T','h','e',' ','q'). The next character is then predicted (as explained in step 2). 
        Assume that this character was 'J'. We then construct a new sequence using the last 4 (=SEQ_LENGTH-1) characters of the previous
        sequence ('h','e',' ','q') , and the predicted letter 'J'. This new sequence is then used to compute the next character and 
        the process continues.
